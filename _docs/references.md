# Technical Reference materials

This page is for holding useful links.

## Tidepool-internal Links

[API User Guide](/tidepool-api/index)
: An attempt at a usage-oriented guide to the Tidepool API. Still a work in progress, but we hope itâ€™s useful.

[Tidepool Data Model](/data-model/v1)
: Defines the data structures we store for medical data and how they're organized.

[Getting Started](/starting-up-services)
: The place you should look if you're trying to get the Tidepool software stack running.

[Metrics Glossary](/metrics-glossary)
: This is the glossary of terms used in our metrics reporting. Mostly useful internally, but someday we may be able to share all the information coming from our metrics.

[About Serial Ports](/serial-ports)
: This is a document that explains the challenges we have working with devices that communicate over serial ports.

Platform Notes
: This is a set of links to notes about working on particular platforms. The Tidepool team develops internally on Macs, and deploys on Ubuntu linux on AWS, so our systems are tuned for those platforms. This document contains information (usually provided by third parties) about working with other platforms.

 * [Notes](/raspberry-pi-getting-started) about running the full stack on a Raspberry Pi.
