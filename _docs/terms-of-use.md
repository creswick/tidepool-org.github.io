**B.** To facilitate your use of the Tidepool Apps, you hereby grant to Tidepool a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, store, reproduce and display any Information you store or manage through the Tidepool Apps solely as reasonably necessary to operate the Tidepool Apps at your direction and on your behalf, and subject to these Terms and our Privacy Policy[include link].

**3.3 Information Security**

The security and privacy of your Information is important. Tidepool uses industry standard, or better, administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the security, confidentiality and integrity of your Information. For example, data that you upload from your diabetes devices is stored and encrypted separately from any personal information or metadata you share with Tidepool. All information and data is encrypted both at rest and during transport. TIDEPOOL SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, HACKING, OR OTHER SECURITY INTRUSIONS OR FAILURE TO STORE OR THE THEFT, DELETION, CORRUPTION, DESTRUCTION, DAMAGE, OR LOSS OF ANY DATA OR INFORMATION.
